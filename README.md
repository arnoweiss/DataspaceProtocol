## About versions of the Dataspace Protocol

Since [version 0.8](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/DataspaceProtocol/tree/main/releases/v0.8)
the specification has been stable with changes in details. Its The last release candidate ([2024-1](https://docs.internationaldataspaces.org/ids-knowledgebase/dataspace-protocol))
of the Dataspace Protocol specification is considered to be stable. It was specified under governance of the [International Dataspaces Association](https://internationaldataspaces.org/). 
Further changes shall not affect conformity. 

Now, the spec is maintained and developed by the [`eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base`](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/technology.dataspace-protocol-base) 
Eclipse Project under the umbrella of the [Eclipse Dataspace Working Group](https://dataspace.eclipse.org/) (EDWG).

## Abstract

The __Dataspace Protocol__ is a set of specifications designed to facilitate interoperable data sharing between entities
governed by usage control and based on Web technologies. These specifications define the schemas and protocols required
for entities to publish data, negotiate [Agreements](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/#dfn-agreement), and access data as
part of a federation of technical systems termed a [Dataspace](https://eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base.github.io/DataspaceProtocol/#dfn-dataspace).

## Introduction

## Best Practices

The Dataspace Protocol is under development and the working group is active on this draft, reviewed and improved the
content multiple times. During the process several aspects were discussed, which are not considered part of the
normative specification, but important to be documented as support for the users of this specification as best
practices. The [Best Practices](https://github.com/eclipse-dataspace-protocol-base/dsp_best_practices) are non-normative.

Users of this specification are invited to provide feedback such as, but not limited to:

* What information is missing?
* What information, including examples, would you like to see?
* What did you like in this document?

Please provide your feedback as a Discussion in this repository.
